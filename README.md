*Homemade, from scratch, with fewer libs possible (and built-in only) brainfuck interpreter in C... trying to improve skills*

## QUICK HOW TO USE

For now? You can't, it's a WIP...

## METHODOLOGY NOTE

I used here (for the first time i think) a quick writing methodolgy so it's easier to navigate.<br>
If you have to check the code here how it works:<br><br>
	-Each function has a comment that describe it's purpose, only on .c file.<br><br>
	-Main function is always the one at the bottom of src/main.c .<br><br>
	-Functions are sort by type then by alphabetical order.<br><br>
	-Var that are not parameters are sort by type then alphabetical order.<br><br>
	-Type order is, from top to bottom, int then char then void. The exception being main(). I don't need other types for now so they are not in my methodology yet.<br><br>
	-If you're looking for a function you should look at headers. They should be in include/ .

## ERROR CODES

You can't use it so there is nothing for now but we'll see later...

## AFTERWORDS

Well this is just a project for getting more at ease with C languages (with pretty rude conditions?)<br>
If you want to use it, please help yourself, thank you, but to be fair I'll be surprised.<br>
If you want to send me feedbacks, advice or criticism, I'm open to it as long as it's done in a civilised way (respecting other is respecting yourself)<br><br>
Anyway, thank you, take care and stay hazy~~ <br><br>
